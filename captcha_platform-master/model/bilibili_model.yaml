# Sites: A bindable parameter used to select a model.
# - If this parameter is defined,
# - it can be identified by using the model_site parameter
# - to identify a model that is inconsistent with the actual size of the current model.
# ModelName: Corresponding to the model file in the model directory,
# - such as YourModelName.pb, fill in YourModelName here.
# ModelType: This parameter is also used to locate the model.
# - The difference from the sites is that if there is no corresponding site,
# - the size will be used to assign the model.
# - If a model of the corresponding size and corresponding to the ModelType is not found,
# - the model belonging to the category is preferentially selected.
# CharSet: Provides a default optional built-in solution:
# - [ALPHANUMERIC, ALPHANUMERIC_LOWER, ALPHANUMERIC_UPPER,
# -- NUMERIC, ALPHABET_LOWER, ALPHABET_UPPER, ALPHABET]
# - Or you can use your own customized character set like: ['a', '1', '2'].
# CharExclude: CharExclude should be a list, like: ['a', '1', '2']
# - which is convenient for users to freely combine character sets.
# - If you don't want to manually define the character set manually,
# - you can choose a built-in character set
# - and set the characters to be excluded by CharExclude parameter.
